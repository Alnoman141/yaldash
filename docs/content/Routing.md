## Routing

After running `php artisan route:list` you will see a few new routes that have been added to your project which look like the following:

| URI         | METHODS  | 
| :---        | :----:   |  
| Dashboard   | GET      | 
| Manage      | GET      | 
| post        | GET-POST-PUT| 
| Settings    | GET-POST | 
| Users       | GET-POST | 
| Checkout    | GET      | 
| Store       | GET-POST  |
